### Operating Instructions =============
*All pages are designed to run and interact with one another on a local machine. Web pages are not hosted on a central server.
1. Open GitBash window in same directory as app.py.
2. Run at command "python app.py".
3. Open browswer and navigate to localhost:5000. This page will activate scripts to run to scrape websites.
4. Click the "Click to Scrape Top Mars Headline" button. Or navigate to localhost:5000/scrape and reload/refresh the page. This executes the scrape_mars.py script. Scraped web data will display in browser.
5. Open MongoDB and view scraped data in mars_app database.

* See also jupyter notebook for detailed notes on scripts and outputs.
